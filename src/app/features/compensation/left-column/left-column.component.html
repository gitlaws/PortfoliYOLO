    <h2>Minimum Wage vs. Living Wage vs. True Living Wage vs. Adult Wage</h2>

    <p>
      Living wage (or subsistence wage) is a measure of basic needs that draws
      on geographically specific data related to a family’s likely minimum costs
      for food, childcare, health insurance, housing, transportation, and other
      basic necessities. It determines the minimum employment earnings necessary
      to meet basic needs while also maintaining financial self-sufficiency,
      taking into account income and payroll taxes. Living wage is the minimum
      income standard that draws a very fine line between financial independence
      and the need to seek out public assistance or suffer consistent and severe
      housing and food insecurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living wage, unlike minimum wage, factors in cost of living, which may
      vary by location. The range in the U.S. varies widely. For example, the
      most expensive places to live are Hawaii and Washington D.C., where one
      would need to make $38.57 per hour and $39.41, respectively, to meet the
      basic necessities as an adult with one child. Two states that have the
      lowest cost of living are South Dakota and Mississippi, where one would
      still need to make $27.06 and $26.74 to meet basic needs. Further in many
      places $15 per hour would not be a sufficient living wage for a single
      person. Even without children, living wages in Hawaii and Washington D.C.
      are $19.43 and $20.49, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that the living wage calculation is based on
      working full-time hours, 52 weeks per year, and does not factor in the
      opportunity to take unpaid time off for illness, family leave, or
      vacation. It also does not include setting aside any income as savings for
      emergencies, large purchases such as a car or house, or retirement. It
      also excludes the comforts that many people think of as essential to
      “living,” such as occasionally eating out, birthday and holiday gifts and
      celebrations, cable television or streaming services, high speed internet,
      and education expenses.

      Living wage should be viewed as an entry point to the conversation about
      wages–the amount necessary just to get by.

      real cost of living in our area. Based on my research, a living wage in
      [Your City] would be around [Living Wage Amount]. Could we discuss how my
      current salary aligns with this standard?

      necessities like housing, food, and healthcare. I've learned that a living
