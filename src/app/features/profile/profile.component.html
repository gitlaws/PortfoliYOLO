      With a solid foundation in full-stack development and a passion for
      crafting clean, efficient code, I’m eager to dive into all stages of
      development—from design and coding to troubleshooting and debugging.
      Here’s what I bring to the table: Full-Stack Expertise: My hands-on
      experience spans both front-end and back-end technologies, including
      Angular, React, asynchronous JavaScript, and API integration. I can unit
      test with a variety of tools ensuring test driven development. Performance
      Optimization: I specialize in transforming slow applications into
      high-performance scalable apps, enhancing user experience through
      effective code refactoring and optimization. Continuous Learning:
      Following industry trends and tools is a priority for me. Whether it’s
      exploring AI technologies or the latest code methods and engaging with
      developer communities, I’m committed to ongoing growth and learning.
      Project Management: I employ a rigorous SDLC-based approach to deliver
      successful projects, effectively balancing structure with agile
      adaptability.
