    As a UI/UX designer with a strong foundation in Angular, I specialize in

    applications that not only look good but also perform excellently. My
    proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript allows me to implement modern
    design principles and ensure seamless user interactions across all device
    types.
