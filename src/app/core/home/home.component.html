      As a UI/UX designer with a strong foundation in Angular, I specialize in
      creating intuitive and engaging user experiences. Leveraging the power of
      Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, and NgRx, I build responsive and interactive
      web applications that not only look good but also perform excellently. My
      proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript allows me to implement modern
      design principles and ensure seamless user interactions across all device
      types.
